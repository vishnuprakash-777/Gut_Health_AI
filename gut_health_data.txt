Gut health is central to digestion, immunity, and mental well-being. An imbalance in the microbiome can cause symptoms like bloating, constipation, fatigue, and even skin issues.

Probiotics such as *Lactobacillus* and *Bifidobacterium* help support a healthy gut. Prebiotics like fiber feed good bacteria. Fermented foods like kefir, kimchi, and yogurt are beneficial.

Gut-brain axis links the digestive system with mood and sleep. Poor gut health can lead to anxiety, brain fog, and poor sleep quality.

Common disruptors of gut health include antibiotics, processed food, stress, and lack of sleep. Healing strategies include fiber-rich diets, hydration, movement, and stress reduction.

SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) causes bloating, gas, and discomfort. It can be managed with diet changes and targeted treatments.

Healing the gut takes time. Track what foods help or harm, and donâ€™t hesitate to consult a registered dietitian or functional medicine provider.
